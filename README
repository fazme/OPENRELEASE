This project is aimed to impove functionality of current version of RELEASE.
 OPENRELEASE isn't the whole replacement of RELEASE but a wrapper with
 additional features that RELEASE is lack for.

Currently implemented features:
 - daemonization (-d option),
 - configuration via a config file (example: cfg/openrelease.cfg),
   - stdin/stdout redirection to a fifo/file,
   - additional log file,
   - enable/disable divx preview,
 - remote keys remapping via keymap config file (example: cfg/openrelease_keymap.cfg)

Requirements:
 - RELEASE.cfg from firmware,
 - object files and libs to build RELEASE,
 - mipsel-gcc-uclibc-mips32 toolchain,
 - firmware kernel sources,
 - lzopack

Configuration:
 - add path to toolchain and lzopack to PATH environment,
 - create custom openrelease.cfg and openrelease_keymap.cfg if needed
 - create config.mk if needed

Build:
 Currently supported dynamic and static builds of RELEASE and OPENRELEASE.
  After successfull build openrelease.epk will be located in the root directory of
  OPENRELEASE sources.
 - Dynamic build: resulting image will be included dynamicly linked RELEASE and OPENRELEASE,
    all shared libraries needed for execution and config files if some were specified.
   	make
 - Static build: resulting image will be included staticly linked binary of RELEASE or OPENRELEASE
    and config files if some were specified. In case of OPENRELEASE build symlink named RELEASE to
    OPENRELEASE will be also included in an image.
    - for RELEASE build
    	make STATIC=RELEASE
    - for OPENRELEASE build
    	make STATIC=OPENRELEASE
 Each build command can be supplemented with following options:
 - VERBOSE=1 to be more verbose during build,
 - DEBUG=1 - to build binary with debug info. Image wiil be also included source files,
 - RELEASE_LIB=<path> - to specify location of RELEASE objects and libraries,
 - RELEASE_CFG=<file> - to specify location of RELEASE.cfg file,
 - OPENRELEASE_CONFIG=<file> - to specify location of openrelease.cfg file,
 - OPENRELEASE_KEYMAP=<file> - to specify location of openrelease_keymap.cfg file,
 - KERNEL_SOURCES=<path> - to specify location of kernel source directory.
 Any of this option can be specified in a config.mk file in root OPENRELESE directory.
